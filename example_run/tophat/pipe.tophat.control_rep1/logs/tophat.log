[2017-01-03 22:29:58] Resuming TopHat pipeline with unmapped reads
Warning: you have only one segment per read.
	If the read length is greater than or equal to 45bp,
	we strongly recommend that you decrease --segment-length to about half the read length because TopHat will work better with multiple segments
